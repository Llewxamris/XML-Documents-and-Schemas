# XML-Documents-and-Schemas
Create well-formed and valid XML documents using schemas. Written for 420-B51 
(Web Programming V). This assignment was split into four parts, each with it's
own goal.

## Part A - Creating XML Documents
Create an XML document `countries.xml` that contains the data given in the
`countries.txt` file. Attach `countries.css` for processing. Lastly, create a
schema for the XML file.

## Part B - XML Namespaces
Convert `stars.html` to an XML file by adding namespaces for XHTML, actors, and
movies. 

## Part C - XML Schemas
Create schemas for the `client.xml` and `equipment.xml`.

## Part D - Olympic Schema
Create an XSL file which will transform the XML file to an HTML file which looks
like an invoice.
